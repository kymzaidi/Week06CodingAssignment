//c.	Player
//i.	Fields
//1.	hand (List of Card)
//2.	score (set to 0 in the constructor)
//3.	name
//ii.	Methods
//1.	describe (prints out information about the player and calls the describe method for each card in the Hand List)
//2.	flip (removes and returns the top card of the Hand)
//3.	draw (takes a Deck as an argument and calls the draw method on the deck, adding the returned Card to the hand field)
//4.	incrementScore (adds 1 to the Playerâ€™s score field)
